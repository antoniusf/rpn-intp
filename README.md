Some old hp-calculators feature reverse polish notation. This means that you enter the operands first, and then select an operator. The operands are pushed onto a stack. I thought it would be fun to write a simple python-simulator for that. I began to write the simple functions which can push values onto the stack and operate on them. Then I added an interactive interpreter. Because the old code was very buggy and not very clean, I deleted the repository and started again. Here is it now: **The second version.**
